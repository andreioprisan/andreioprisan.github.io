                           Andrei and I worked together over the course of 6 months on a challenging eCommerce project. Our customer had an existing platform that need to be improved upon, redesigned and relaunched on an upgraded platform (with historical data). Then, the same site needed to be launched in several different EU countries on a tight schedule. The project was a success, finishing ahead of schedule and under budget. <br><br>Andrei's collaboration, communication and dedication throughout the project were second to none. The project success was largely a direct result of Andrei's efforts. As a Project Manager who by and large has very high expectations of myself and team-members, I would not hesitate to endorse Andrei, and actively seek to work with him on future projects.

He is personable, relates well to others, gives instructions in a digestible way, and sets high but realistic goals for improvement. He was a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend him.

                           I have had the pleasure of knowing Andrei Oprisan since September 2010, when I was part of the hiring team that brought him into Lycos Inc in software engineering. Andrei was initially hired as an Associate Engineer and quickly promoted to Software Engineer. This year with his personal time, he has immersed himself in learning and obtaining his certification in product management.
Andrei has deeply impressed me with his love of learning and putting that knowledge into play for the company.
He is one of those exceptional people who is very comfortable working independently or as a team player. He would be a great asset to any company requiring an engineer with a love for learning, strong professional skills and outstanding personal characteristics.

Besides being an able Resident Assistant, Andrei also used his technical prowess and possession to enhance community events and even create a new package notification system which is being increasingly adopted through the New York University residential community. All of these attributes are also supplemented by a bright personality and inviting sense of humor.
